I have a network flow dataset: it has 19 million record, each record is a flow with it label. My task is to classify each flow correctly within 15 classes. My idea here is to build a line graph on this dataset, each record has src ip, src port, dst ip, dst port and other features. I will use each flow as a node in my graph, the problem is i still dont know how to build edges between them. Give me all creative, advance, complex idea you could think of, if you need any information about the data or my thought, as me, no code yet, we are brainstorming

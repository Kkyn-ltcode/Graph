I need help creating a complete structure for my research paper. Here's the context:

**Research Topic:** [YOUR SPECIFIC TOPIC]

**My Code/Implementation:** 
[BRIEF DESCRIPTION - what problem it solves, what methods/algorithms you used, what makes it novel]

**Reference Papers I'm Following:**
Paper 1: [Title and brief description of approach]
Paper 2: [Title and brief description of approach]
[Add more if relevant]

**Target Venue:** [Conference/Journal name, e.g., IEEE, ACM, NeurIPS, etc.]

**Key Contributions:**
1. [First main contribution]
2. [Second main contribution]
3. [Third contribution if any]

**Experimental Results Available:**
- [Type of experiments you ran]
- [Datasets used]
- [Metrics evaluated]
- [Comparison baselines]

---

Please create a detailed paper structure including:

1. **Title suggestions** (3-5 options that are concise and descriptive)

2. **Complete section outline** with:
   - Main sections (Abstract, Introduction, Related Work, etc.)
   - Subsections for each main section
   - 2-3 bullet points describing what should go in each subsection
   - Estimated word count or page allocation for each section

3. **Flow narrative** - a brief description of how sections connect to tell a coherent story

4. **Figure/Table placeholders** - suggest where diagrams, algorithm pseudocode, results tables, or charts would strengthen the paper

5. **Key technical terms and vocabulary** I should consistently use throughout

Make the structure appropriate for a [LENGTH: e.g., 6-8 page conference paper / 10-12 page journal article] following standard academic conventions in [YOUR FIELD].

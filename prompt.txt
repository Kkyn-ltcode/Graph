you are an expert at AI, graph and deep learning engineer, here are my task: Given a dataset which is network flow dataset has 16.94 mil row and 45 columns, your task is to predict flow’s label. There are 2 types of label in this, 1 is binary, 2 is multi  which might be one of 10 classes (Normal and 9 different types of network attack). Here is the informations about the columns:
Feature,Description
IPV4_SRC_ADDR,IPv4 source address
IPV4_DST_ADDR,IPv4 destination address
L4_SRC_PORT,IPv4 source port number
L4_DST_PORT,IPv4 destination port number
PROTOCOL,IP protocol identifier byte
L7_PROTO,Layer 7 protocol (numeric)
IN_BYTES,Incoming number of bytes
OUT_BYTES,Outgoing number of bytes
IN_PKTS,Incoming number of packets
OUT_PKTS,Outgoing number of packets
FLOW_DURATION_MILLISECONDS,Flow duration in milliseconds
TCP_FLAGS,Cumulative of all TCP flags
CLIENT_TCP_FLAGS,Cumulative of all client TCP flags
SERVER_TCP_FLAGS,Cumulative of all server TCP flags
DURATION_IN,Client to Server stream duration (msec)
DURATION_OUT,Client to Server stream duration (msec)
MIN_TTL,Min flow TTL
MAX_TTL,Max flow TTL
LONGEST_FLOW_PKT,Longest packet (bytes) of the flow
SHORTEST_FLOW_PKT,Shortest packet (bytes) of the flow
MIN_IP_PKT_LEN,Len of the smallest flow IP packet observed
MAX_IP_PKT_LEN,Len of the largest flow IP packet observed
SRC_TO_DST_SECOND_BYTES,Src to dst Bytes/sec
DST_TO_SRC_SECOND_BYTES,Dst to src Bytes/sec
RETRANSMITTED_IN_BYTES,Number of retransmitted TCP flow bytes (src->dst)
RETRANSMITTED_IN_PKTS,Number of retransmitted TCP flow packets (src->dst)
RETRANSMITTED_OUT_BYTES,Number of retransmitted TCP flow bytes (dst->src)
RETRANSMITTED_OUT_PKTS,Number of retransmitted TCP flow packets (dst->src)
SRC_TO_DST_AVG_THROUGHPUT,Src to dst average thpt (bps)
DST_TO_SRC_AVG_THROUGHPUT,Dst to src average thpt (bps)
NUM_PKTS_UP_TO_128_BYTES,Packets whose IP size <= 128
NUM_PKTS_128_TO_256_BYTES,Packets whose IP size > 128 and <= 256
NUM_PKTS_256_TO_512_BYTES,Packets whose IP size > 256 and <= 512
NUM_PKTS_512_TO_1024_BYTES,Packets whose IP size > 512 and <= 1024
NUM_PKTS_1024_TO_1514_BYTES,Packets whose IP size >1024 and <= 1514
TCP_WIN_MAX_IN,Max TCP Window (src->dst)
TCP_WIN_MAX_OUT,Max TCP Window (dst->src)
ICMP_TYPE,ICMP Type * 256 + ICMP code
ICMP_IPV4_TYPE,ICMP Type
DNS_QUERY_ID,DNS query transaction Id
DNS_QUERY_TYPE,"DNS query type (e.g. 1=A, 2=NS..)"
DNS_TTL_ANSWER,TTL of the first A record (if any)
FTP_COMMAND_RET_CODE,FTP client command return code
Label, normal or not
Attack, 10 types of attack

My goal is to create line graph from it, which is each node is a flow and have node features, i still not sure how to build edge, but  I think we should start with how to handle this data. Now can you code something to extract information, statistic, distribution from this raw data so I could give back the result to you and you will know how to process this data, the ouput should be 1 file so  could upload easy, also, we should use polars for better. Tell me anything you need
